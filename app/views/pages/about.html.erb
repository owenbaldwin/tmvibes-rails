        <br>
        Originally from Warri, Delta State, the region is known for some popular afrobeat artists. Music came his way as a 14-year-old when he joined a local choir.<br>
        Feeling the essence of live music, he was the choir's drummer,and also established skills with the keyboard and guitar.<br>
        His connection with live instruments fuelled his passion for wanting to create music and his talent was enhanced further by learning how to use music production software. Listening to various music styles, such as house music & country, it was afrobeats that captured his heart and he soon began working on his very own productions.
